			<div id="f">All of the photos on the About Us page were from the citation directly about (National Alpha Xi Delta website) except 
				for the Delta Lambda symbol picture with roses, which I created in photoshop. And all of the rest of the pictures are from
				my sorority's instagram or my own personal pictures so I wasn't sure how I was supposed to cite either of those.
				I did not need to use any JavaScript for my project. I think this was my best website of the semester, I think the design
				was thought out the most and flowed really well. All of the content came really easily since this is an organization that I have
				been a part of for the past three years and know a lot about it. I think my css flows well and is well structured especially using
				the css grid. Lastly I used a lot of pictures which made the website look really nice because I feel website with only
				of text are really hard to read through and do not attract users. So I used pictures on all of the page so that the user
				will be immediately drawn to the pages. I think there were a few pages were I could have included more content and explained
				in more detail if I had had more time. And another thing I could improve would be to add JavaScript, it was something I had
				wanted to include in some way but didn't get a chance to implement it. I included four image rollovers on the About Us
				page for the symbol images.</div>
