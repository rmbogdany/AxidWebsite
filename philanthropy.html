			<div id="d">Our chapter supports the local Rochester Autism Speaks Walk by volunteering at it
			each year. The week leading up to the walk we hold a fundraising competition between different
			organizations that want to participate. There are different events throughout the week that we hold
			such as a pancake dinner to raise money for autism awareness and a presentation and information session
			to better inform the RIT community about autism.<br/><br/>
			The second major philanthropy event we hold is our Karaoke for a Cause event at Lovin' Cup here at RIT,
			where many different people and organizations come to help raise money and have a lot of fun participating
			in karaoke.<br/><br/>
			Throughout the school year we promote autism awareness and understanding throughout
			RIT's campus by tablestanding and holding events. As a chapter we also enjoy going out into the community
			to volunteer for our philanthropy through a program called AutismUp to help teach kids how to play basketball.</div>
