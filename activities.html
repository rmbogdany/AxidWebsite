					events! At hockey games we hand out Autism Speaks pins 
					and advertise our events. Other activities our sisters are involved
					in include, Panhellenic Council, Greek Council, Club Field Hockey, 
					Horseback Riding Club, Study Abroad Program, Ultimate Frisbee, RIT Pep Band,

			<div id="ba">Pictured to the right is our chapter and other organizations
				after we finished volunteering at Lollipop Farms which is a local animal
				shelter in Rochester. This is just one of many local businesses that we
				volunteer with. 
				<br/>In addition to volunteering, Alpha Xi Delta's first priority is
				academics. Our chapter in particular is extremely passionate about doing
				well in school since after all this is the reason we are here. To exemplify
				how much we strive to achieve here at RIT there are quite a few of our sisters
				involved in academic fraternities such as the business fraternity and the chemistry
				fraternity here on campus. Our chapter has a higher average GPA than the student
				body average here at RIT, and for multiple years we have achieved highest average
				GPA of all greek life organization. This wasn't an easy achievement as all of the 
				organizations strive to do their best and hold very high GPAs on campus.  </div>

			<div id="d">Supporting other organizations's events and philanthropies
				is extremely important to our chapter and RIT's greek life. Pictured
				to the left is two of our sisters supporting Sigma Chi and Phi Kappa Psi's
				annual Winter Warrior event. The event is a outdoors obstacle course that
				many two person team competing against each other that raises money for
				the Veterans Outreach Center of Greater Rochester. As RIT's greek life community
				is fairly small compared to other college campus's it is essential that we 
				come together as a community and support every organizations events. Other 
				event that we participate in are Zeta Tau Alpha and Phi Kappa Psi's mudtug
				event that is held every fall to support the Hillside Family of Agencies 
				in Rochester and the MLD Foundation. As well as Sigma Chi's week long Derby Days
				fundraiser competition for Huntsmans Cancer Foundation.</div>
